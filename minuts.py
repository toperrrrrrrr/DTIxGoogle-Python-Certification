#In one year, if there are 365 days, with 24 hours in a day, and 60 minutes in an hour, write a program to calculate the number of minutes in a year. Print the result on the screen. Note: Your result should be in the format of just a number, not a sentence.

dayy = 365
hour = 24
minutes = 60 

hoursindays = dayy * hour
minutesinyear = hoursindays * minutes


print(minutesinyear)
print(15+5+(3*2)/4**2+(3-7)*7)

total_computers = 30*20
replacement_cycle = 5
computers_per_year = total_computers/replacement_cycle


print(computers_per_year)

possibilities = 10 ** 8
print(possibilities)
